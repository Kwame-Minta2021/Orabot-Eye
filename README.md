# Orabot Eye - ESP32 Motion Sensor with Telegram Bot

The Orabot Eye repository provides a complete solution for creating a motion sensor system using ESP32 microcontroller and integrating it with a Telegram bot. With this project, you can monitor motion detection in your surroundings and receive instant notifications on your Telegram app.

## Features

- **Motion Detection:** The code in this repository enables ESP32 to interface with a motion sensor, allowing it to detect motion in the environment. When motion is detected, the system triggers an event and sends a notification through the Telegram bot.

- **ESP32 Integration:** The ESP32 microcontroller is utilized for its power and versatility. It provides a reliable platform to interface with the motion sensor and communicate with the Telegram bot API. The code is optimized for ESP32's capabilities, ensuring efficient and effective motion detection.

- **Telegram Bot Integration:** The project includes a Telegram bot that sends notifications to your Telegram app whenever motion is detected. You can easily configure the bot, set up alerts, and receive real-time updates on your mobile device or desktop.

- **Easy Configuration:** The code is designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions and configuration options. You can easily customize settings such as the motion sensor pin, Wi-Fi credentials, and Telegram bot API token to adapt the system to your specific requirements.

- **Flexible Notification System:** The Telegram bot allows you to receive notifications in various ways, such as text messages, images, or even video snippets, depending on your preferences and the capabilities of your ESP32 board. This flexibility ensures you can receive detailed information about detected motion events.

- **Low Power Consumption:** The code is optimized to minimize power consumption, ensuring the system can run for extended periods without draining the battery or requiring frequent recharging. This is particularly useful in scenarios where continuous monitoring is required.

## Getting Started

To set up and use the Orabot Eye motion sensor system with Telegram bot, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the motion sensor to the appropriate pin on the ESP32 board, as specified in the provided wiring diagram. Ensure the ESP32 board is properly connected and powered.

2. **Software Setup:** Install the necessary libraries and dependencies, as listed in the documentation. Configure the ESP32 board settings in the Arduino IDE and upload the provided Arduino code to the board.

3. **Telegram Bot Configuration:** Create a Telegram bot and obtain the API token. Set up the bot and configure the necessary settings, such as allowed users and notification preferences. Detailed instructions are provided in the documentation.

4. **Testing and Integration:** After uploading the code to the ESP32 board, test the system by triggering motion near the motion sensor. Check your Telegram app for notifications and verify that the system is functioning correctly. Make any necessary adjustments to the configuration to suit your preferences.

For more detailed instructions, troubleshooting tips, and information on advanced features, please refer to the documentation provided in the repository.
